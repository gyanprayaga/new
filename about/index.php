        <b>Pictures are worth a thousand words.</b> That's why we create beautiful, precise illustrations to improve the user's experience. This pleases and surprises the user while maintaining overall functionality. We balance simplicity wih creativity, color with structure. Before we even begin illustrating, we think about what we're going to make and how we're going to make it. We translate this into a simple sketch - either on paper or computer. Then we tweak and refine that sketch until we reach our goal (what we originally visualized).
